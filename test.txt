Context & User Persona
•	Add the recap of “What’s the problem, for who” and “Why do we want to solve it” 
(from the Product Doc)
•	Add the success metrics of the project
•	Add the scope of the project (the Must and Should that were prioritized)
Global Workflow: Releases & User Stories
•	Write macro user stories explaining the global workflow of the feature and split them into several releases (if applicable). 
Ex for Airbnb: As a new host with an incomplete profile, when I create my listing, I should see a new section asking me to add pictures
Workflow Diagram & Designs
•	Add link to prototype and/or screen by screen designs
•	Add also the copy
Edge Cases
•	Think about the edge cases (if there is a workflow diagram, they should be included in it)
Tracking Plan
•	How will you measure the success? Define here the elements that need to be tracked. 
If complex, add a link to the tracking plan (example here). 
Test Plan & Rollout
For now, do not fill the “test plan” and "rollout" section. We'll see that in the coming days!
