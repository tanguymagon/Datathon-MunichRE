Hello Marga & Yani & team -

Just looking at the article accession number it was generated 20230605 - that is this year June the 5th.
 
If you think of streams as roughly analogous to Factiva alerts - and snapshots to be roughly analogous to an a Factiva archive search.
 
Not a perfect analogy, but conceptually pretty good in this particular.
 
The stream is essentially news moving forward with a very limited archive.
 
This stream was not created until July - about a month after the article was published.
 
Without checking anything else, this seems to be why the article was not associated with the stream.

If a meeting is still desirable, please provide an agenda, so that I can make sure we have people with the appropriate skill set, and have time to prepare.
