I would like to take this opportunity to ask you some questions about the data, more specifically concerning the source_names and the duplicated/similar articles from those sources, so I’ll list my questions below, if you don’t understand them ore need more clarification, please let me know.

 

We have noticed that annually we extract around 330000 articles per year, of which we finally use only around 225000 because we find many articles that are duplicates, that is to say that they have exactly the same content or one very similar, at the same time these articles have different 'an' so according to your definition they are different articles, so I think my first question is, don't you have some algorithm or model that helps to identify similar articles or at least that allow us to filter on these at the moment of extraction?
We have also remarked that when creating an 'an' the principle is not the same for all the sources, I think you will understand more quickly with this example, The ‘an’ of the  'source_name' “Les Echos” has different ways to start like ECHOS0, ECHOFR, CAPFIN, CAPFIF, ECHWE0, LECERC, ECHOBF and echos0, whereas “Les Echos.fr” has only one way of starting which is  ECHOFR, so we would like to know how do you associate the 'an' to the source_name or how do you create an ‘an’?
As you could see from my previous questions we filtered the articles we found as duplicates, while we were doing this analysis, we found that for the same source like for exemple ‘La Tribune’, the same article has a different format based on the source_name, so we would like to know why? Example

From previous discussions, you explained to us that when the source has .fr in the name it means that it is a source that comes from the electronic version of the newspaper, while when it doesn't it comes from the paper version, so we have the theory that by applying the OCR or whatever algorithm you use to digitize the paper version the format changes and becomes less readable, are we right?

 

4. We would also like to know if you have a way of identifying what is the best/first version of an article (imagining that you are able to identify similar articles), meaning if it is an article that originally came in the electronic version and then it was printed in the paper version or if it was the opposite? As we found that around 95% of our duplicates come within the same source.
