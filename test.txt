Educational Foundation: My career in data analysis and data science began with a solid educational foundation, rooted in economics and statistics. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Economics from the prestigious Toulouse School of Economics, followed by a Master's in Statistics and Econometrics. This academic journey provided me with a deep understanding of economic principles and quantitative analysis, setting the stage for my entry into the professional world.
Early Professional Experiences: After my first year of the Master's program, I seized an exciting opportunity to intern in Dubai for a Managing General Agent Lloyd's coverholder. Here, I served as a Data Analyst in the space sector and as a Data Scientist in the aviation sector. This role was my first foray into the practical application of data analytics in industry-specific contexts, offering valuable insights into complex data sets and their strategic implications.
Apprenticeship and Early Career Growth: During my second Master's year, I embarked on an apprenticeship at BNP Paribas Personal Finance. Balancing academics and professional commitments, I worked as a Data Scientist while continuing my studies. This dual role not only honed my analytical skills but also taught me the art of juggling multiple responsibilities. Upon completion of my studies, BNP Paribas recognized my contributions and potential, leading to a full-time position where I stayed for three years.
Seeking New Challenges: Despite that this role at BNP Paribas was quite comfortable for me, I found myself looking for more dynamic challenges and the opportunity to diversify my experience. This desire led me to EY, where I transitioned into a consulting role. At EY, I tackled various projects for major banks, contributing significantly to internal initiatives such as developing chatbots and gamification for HR processes. It allowed me to work with clients like Natixis and BPCE, further diversifying my professional portfolio, as Data analyst, Data Scientist and Product Ownerm.
Continuous Learning and Engagement: Throughout my career, I have actively sought opportunities to engage in data challenges, participating in events hosted by ESCP in London and MunichRE in Munich, and contributing to projects at BNP. These experiences not only kept my analytical skills sharp but also fueled my passion for solving complex problems and delivering data-driven solutions.
Why SiriusPoint? Now, as I stand at the next crossroads of my career, I am drawn to SiriusPoint for its dynamic and forward-thinking environment. SiriusPoint's reputation for innovation in data analytics and its commitment to leveraging data for strategic decision-making align perfectly with my career aspirations.

In summary, my career journey, marked by a strong academic background, diverse professional experiences, and a continuous quest for challenges, has uniquely prepared me to contribute meaningfully to SiriusPoint.

Defauts : 

1.	Impatience: "I would say I have a sense of urgency in my work. This means I am eager to see results and can be impatient for progress. However, this drives me to work efficiently and push projects forward quickly, which in fast-paced environments, can be a strong advantage.
2.	Stubbornness: "I'm someone who is very committed to my ideas and can be perceived as stubborn exemple when I wanted to do the master in statistics and ecometrics. But this also means I am dedicated and persistent when facing challenges. It's a trait that helps me stay the course on projects, ensuring they reach their full potential."
3.	Distrust: "I approach new information with a critical eye and can be cautious in accepting facts at face value, which might come off as distrustful. However, this skepticism ensures that I thoroughly vet data and decisions, which is crucial in the field of actuarial science and risk management."


Why moving from data science to data analytics : 

Focus on Immediate Insights: Data analysts often focus on extracting actionable insights from data, which can be more immediately applicable to business decisions. This shift can be appealing for individuals interested in directly influencing business strategies and outcomes.

Aligning with Long-Term Career Goals: For some, data analysis might align more closely with their long-term career aspirations, perhaps in a managerial or business-oriented role, where the focus is more on applying data insights rather than developing complex data models.
